Reinforcment Learning in Chapel.  Some experiments, probably won't last long but may be useful if you're trying to learn one or the other.

* Maybe [this one](http://www.mnemstudio.org/path-finding-q-learning-tutorial.htm)
* Richard Sutton has [some pseudocode](http://www.incompleteideas.net/td-backprop-pseudo-code.text).
* [This talk](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/tutorial-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-with-function-approximation/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fapps%2Fvideo%2F%3Fid%3D259577) by Sutton was very useful to me.
* The Sutton and Barto book as [associated code](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/code/code.html)  Also there is a [matlab version](http://waxworksmath.com/Authors/N_Z/Sutton/sutton.html) which is marginally more legible than Lisp
* David Silver has all of his lectures as a [Youtube Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-jPKtc4r78-wCZcQn5IqyuWhBZ8fOxT)
